## 🔍 The Problem

### Before: Circular Redirect Loop ❌

```
User visits: /creator/onboarding
     ↓
Parent layout: /creator/(protected)/layout.tsx
     ↓
Checks: Is onboarding complete?
     ↓
No → Redirects to: /creator/onboarding
     ↓
INFINITE LOOP! 🔄
Result: AuthSessionMissingError
```

### Root Cause
Onboarding route was inside the `(protected)` route group, whose layout checked if onboarding was complete before allowing access. This created a circular dependency where the onboarding page couldn't be accessed because its parent layout redirected to it.

---

## ✅ The Solution

### After: Clean Separation

```
User visits: /creator/onboarding
     ↓
Parent layout: /creator/onboarding/layout.tsx
     ↓
Checks: 
  ✓ Authenticated?
  ✓ Is creator?
  ✓ Already completed? → dashboard
     ↓
Allow access to onboarding ✅
     ↓
User completes onboarding
     ↓
Redirects to: /creator/dashboard ✅
```

### Key Changes

#### 1. Moved Onboarding Routes Outside Protected Groups
```
OLD: /creator/(protected)/onboarding/
NEW: /creator/onboarding/
```

#### 2. Created Dedicated Onboarding Layouts
- `src/app/creator/onboarding/layout.tsx`
- `src/app/platform-owner-onboarding/layout.tsx`

These layouts:
- ✅ Check authentication and role only
- ✅ Allow access during onboarding
- ✅ Redirect to dashboard if already complete

#### 3. Simplified Protected Layouts
- `src/app/creator/(protected)/layout.tsx`
- `src/app/(platform)/layout.tsx`

These layouts:
- ✅ Check authentication, role, and onboarding completion
- ✅ Redirect to onboarding if not complete
- ✅ Use cached role data (removed redundant DB calls)

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Unit Tests: ✅ All Passing
```bash
$ npm test -- enhanced-auth-service.test.ts

PASS src/features/account/controllers/__tests__/enhanced-auth-service.test.ts
  EnhancedAuthService
    ✓ Role detection logic (7/7 tests)
    ✓ Route guards
    ✓ Onboarding flow

Test Suites: 1 passed
Tests:       7 passed
```

### Linting: ✅ Clean
```bash
$ npm run lint

✔ No ESLint warnings or errors
```

### Build: ⚠️ Note
One pre-existing type error in `assets/page.tsx` unrelated to routing changes. Our changes introduce no new errors.

## 🎯 Benefits

### 1. Eliminates Navigation Issues ✅
- **Before**: Circular redirects, `AuthSessionMissingError`
- **After**: Smooth, predictable routing

### 2. Improves Performance ✅
- Removed redundant `getCreatorProfile()` database call
- Uses cached role detection from `EnhancedAuthService`
- Faster route resolution

### 3. Simplifies Architecture ✅
- Single responsibility per layout
- Consistent patterns across all routes
- Easier to understand and maintain

### 4. Enhances User Experience ✅
- Uninterrupted onboarding flow
- Clear navigation paths
- No confusing errors

### 5. Ensures Consistency ✅
- Platform and creator follow identical patterns
- Predictable behavior for all user roles
- Easy to extend for new roles

---

## 🔄 User Flows

### New Creator Signup ✅
```
1. Sign up → Assigned role: 'creator'
2. Auth callback redirects to: /creator/onboarding
3. Onboarding layout allows access
4. User completes onboarding
5. Redirects to: /creator/dashboard
6. Protected layout allows access
```

### Existing Creator Login ✅
```
1. Log in → Role: 'creator', onboarded: true
2. Auth callback redirects to: /creator/dashboard
3. Protected layout allows access
```

### Skip Attempt ✅
```
1. Incomplete creator tries: /creator/dashboard
2. Protected layout detects: onboarding incomplete
3. Redirects to: /creator/onboarding
4. Onboarding layout allows access
```

### Already Complete ✅
```
1. Complete creator tries: /creator/onboarding
2. Onboarding layout detects: already onboarded
3. Redirects to: /creator/dashboard
4. Protected layout allows access
```
