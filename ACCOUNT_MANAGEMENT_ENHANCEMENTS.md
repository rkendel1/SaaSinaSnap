### 3. Accessibility Improvements

#### Automatic Contrast Calculation

**New Functions Added:**

  // Calculates relative luminance per WCAG guidelines
  // Returns value 0-1 (black to white)
}

function getContrastingTextColor(backgroundColor: string): string {
  // Returns '#000000' or '#ffffff' for optimal contrast
  // Ensures minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio
}
```

**Applied To:**
- Primary button text colors
- Gradient text fallbacks
- All branded interactive elements

#### WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance

âœ… **Color Contrast**
- Normal text: Minimum 4.5:1 ratio
- Large text: Minimum 3:1 ratio
- Automatic calculation prevents low-contrast combinations

### 4. Build Error Fixes

// Before (line 4):
import { Code, Copy, Edit, Eye, MoreHorizontal, ... } from 'lucide-react';

// After:
import { Code, Copy, Edit, Eye, FileText, MoreHorizontal, ... } from 'lucide-react';
```
**File:** `src/features/creator/components/EmbedManagerClient.tsx`

**Issue 2: JSX Syntax Error**
```tsx
// Before (incorrect):
{condition && (
  {/* comment */}
  <div>content</div>
)}

// After (correct):
{condition && (
  /* comment */
  <div>content</div>
)}
```
**File:** `src/features/platform-owner-onboarding/components/steps/DefaultCreatorSettingsStep.tsx`

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Sources

**Creator Account Page:**
- `getAuthenticatedUser()` - Current user session
- `getCreatorProfile()` - Creator business information
- `getSubscription()` - Active subscription data with related prices and products
- `getUser()` - Extended user profile data

**White-Label Account Page:**
- `getCreatorBySlug()` - Creator profile by custom domain
- `getWhiteLabeledPage()` - Page configuration
- `CustomerTierPortal` - Usage tracking integration
- Mock data for billing history (to be replaced with Stripe API calls)

### Styling Approach

**Tailwind CSS Classes:**
- Gray scale for text: `text-gray-900`, `text-gray-600`, `text-gray-500`
- Semantic colors: 
  - Green: Success, Active, Paid
  - Blue: Info, Trial
  - Yellow: Warning, Pending
  - Red: Error, Over Limit
- Spacing: Consistent 4, 6, 8, 12 unit spacing
- Rounded corners: `rounded-lg` for cards
- Shadows: `shadow-sm`, `shadow-md` for depth

**Dynamic Brand Styling:**
```typescript
// Applied via inline styles from brandingStyles:
style={brandingStyles.primaryButton}
style={brandingStyles.outlineButton}
style={brandingStyles.gradientText}
style={brandingStyles.softGradientBackground}
```

## Integration Points

### Stripe Billing Portal

Both account pages link to Stripe's hosted billing portal:

**Creator Route:** `/creator/account/manage-subscription`
- Uses platform's Stripe account
- Manages creator's subscription to SaaSinaSnap

**Customer Route:** `/c/[creatorSlug]/manage-subscription`
- Uses creator's connected Stripe account
- Manages customer's subscription to creator's product

### Invoice Management

Currently redirects to Stripe Billing Portal for:
- Invoice downloads
- Payment history
- Payment method updates
- Billing information changes

**Future Enhancement:** Direct invoice fetching via Stripe API

### Usage Tracking

Integration with `CustomerTierPortal` component:
```typescript
<CustomerTierPortal creatorId={creator.id} />
```

Displays real-time usage data from the usage tracking system.

## Known Limitations

### Current Implementation

1. **Mock Billing Data**: Recent billing history uses mock data

2. **Static Usage Data**: Plan features show example usage
   - **Solution**: Connect to real usage tracking APIs

3. **No Payment Method Display**: Current payment method not shown inline
   - **Solution**: Fetch from Stripe customer object

4. **Invoice Downloads**: Redirect to Stripe portal
   - **Solution**: Implement direct PDF downloads via Stripe API

### Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Usage Updates**: WebSocket integration for live usage data
2. **Usage Alerts**: Email/push notifications when approaching limits
3. **Invoice Email**: Send invoices automatically after payment
4. **Multi-currency**: Display amounts in customer's currency
5. **Payment Retry**: Automated retry for failed payments
6. **Proration Display**: Show prorated amounts for plan changes
