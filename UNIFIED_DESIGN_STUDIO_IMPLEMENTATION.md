# Unified Design Studio Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of a unified Design Studio that merges the previously separate "Design Studio", "Embeds & Scripts", and "Asset Library" sections into a single, cohesive location.

## Problem Statement

The goal was to enhance the user experience by:
1. Merging "Design Studio" and "Embeds" sections into a unified location
2. Including the "Asset Library" in this unified section
3. Adding functionality to copy embed codes and preview embeds
4. Displaying design tokens, data samples, tone, and voice information from the site analyzer
5. Redesigning designer steps to be intuitive and flexible, not prescriptive
6. Making AI-based design assistance optional but functional with site analyzer data

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Section Consolidation

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/creator/(protected)/embeds-and-scripts/page.tsx`
- `src/app/(platform)/dashboard/embeds-and-scripts/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Converted these pages to simple redirects to the unified Design Studio manage page
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing links

```typescript
// Redirect to unified Design Studio Manage page
export default async function EmbedsAndScriptsPage() {
  redirect('/creator/design-studio/manage');
}
```

### 2. Navigation Updates

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/role-based-navigation.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Removed duplicate "Embeds & Scripts" navigation entries
- Updated Design Studio description to indicate it includes asset management
- Consolidated navigation for both platform owners and creators

**Before:**
```
- Design Studio (Create embeds)
- Embeds & Scripts (Manage embeds)
```

**After:**
```
- Design Studio (Create embeds, manage assets with AI-powered tools)
```

### 3. Enhanced Landing Pages

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/creator/(protected)/design-studio/page.tsx`
- `src/app/(platform)/dashboard/design-studio/page.tsx`

**Changes:**

- Content samples

**From AI Service:**
```typescript
const brandingData = creator.extracted_branding_data;
// AI prompt includes:
// - Color Palette: Primary [...] | Secondary [...]
// - Typography System: {...}
// - Brand Voice & Tone: {...}
// - Design Language: {...}
// - Layout Preferences: {...}
```

## Technical Details

### Design Token Extraction

Design tokens are extracted from the creator profile's `extracted_branding_data`:

```typescript
export function extractDesignTokens(profile: CreatorProfile): DesignTokens {
  const extractedData = profile.extracted_branding_data;
  
  return {
    '--brand-color': profile.brand_color || extractedData?.primaryColors?.[0],
    '--font-family': extractedData?.fonts?.primary || 'inherit',
    '--font-family-heading': extractedData?.fonts?.headings,
    '--border-radius': extractedData?.designTokens?.borderRadius,
    '--spacing': extractedData?.designTokens?.spacing,
    '--shadow': extractedData?.designTokens?.shadows?.[0],
    // ... more tokens
  };
}
```

### Preview System

Embeds use two modes:

1. **Preview Mode** (Dashboard)
   - Wraps embed in container with design tokens applied
   - Simulates how embed will appear on creator's site
   - Uses extracted branding data

2. **Production Mode** (Live Site)
   - Inherits styles from host website
   - Uses CSS custom properties
   - Adapts to site's design system

### Data Flow

```
Site Analyzer
    ↓
extracted_branding_data (stored in creator_profiles)
    ↓
extractDesignTokens() utility
    ↓
    ├── Preview wrapper (design tokens applied)
    ├── AI prompts (branding context)
    └── Design Tokens Dialog (user reference)
```

## Benefits

   - Verify all links to embeds-and-scripts redirect properly
   - Check navigation updates work for both roles
   - Test backward compatibility

2. **Design Token Display**
   - Test with profiles that have extracted data
   - Test with profiles that don't have extracted data
   - Verify all token types display correctly

3. **AI Workflow**
   - Create asset without using AI
   - Create asset with AI assistance
   - Verify AI uses branding data in prompts

4. **Preview System**

## Conclusion

The unified Design Studio successfully consolidates previously separate sections into a cohesive experience. The implementation maintains backward compatibility while improving information architecture and user flow. Design tokens and site analyzer data are now prominently featured, making it easier for users to create brand-consistent embeds. The AI assistant is clearly optional while still providing value through leveraging extracted branding data.
