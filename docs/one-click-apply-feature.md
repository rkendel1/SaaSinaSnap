## Technical Implementation

### Backend Integration

The feature integrates with the existing creator profile system:

```typescript
// Apply complete palette in one action
export async function applyColorPaletteAction(palette: ColorPalette) {
  return updateCreatorProfile(userId, {
    brand_color: palette.primary,
    brand_gradient: palette.gradient,
    brand_pattern: palette.pattern,
  });
}
```

### Data Structure

```typescript
interface ColorPalette {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  primary: string;      // Main brand color
  secondary: string;    // Complementary color
  accent: string;       // Highlight color
  gradient: GradientConfig;  // Background gradients
  pattern: PatternConfig;    // Pattern overlays
}
```

### Palette Generation

Palettes are generated using advanced color theory:

```typescript
// Generate palette from extracted website colors
const suggestedPalettes = generateSuggestedPalettes(extractedColors);

// Create palette from single color
const customPalette = generatePaletteFromColor(primaryColor, 'Custom');
```
