## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features Explained

### Subscription Tiers

Define your pricing plans:

```javascript
{
  name: 'Pro',
  price: 99.99,
  billing_cycle: 'monthly',
  feature_entitlements: ['advanced_analytics', 'team_seats:25'],
  usage_caps: { api_calls: 100000, storage_gb: 50 },
  trial_period_days: 14
}
```

**Learn more**: [Quick Start - Step 2](./TIERING_QUICKSTART.md#step-2-create-your-first-tier-5-minutes)

### Usage Tracking

Monitor customer usage:

```javascript
await trackUsage({
  event_name: 'api_calls',
  user_id: 'customer_123',
  event_value: 1,
  properties: { endpoint: '/api/data' }
});
```

**Learn more**: [Quick Start - Step 3](./TIERING_QUICKSTART.md#step-3-set-up-usage-tracking-5-minutes)

### Usage Enforcement

Check limits before processing:

```javascript
const enforcement = await checkEnforcement(userId, 'api_calls');

if (!enforcement.allowed) {
  throw new Error('Usage limit exceeded');
}
```

**Learn more**: [Quick Start - Step 4](./TIERING_QUICKSTART.md#step-4-enforce-usage-limits-5-minutes)

### Feature Gating

Restrict features by tier:

```javascript
if (tierInfo.feature_entitlements.includes('advanced_analytics')) {
  // Show advanced features
}
```

**Learn more**: [Integration Examples - Feature Gating](./TIERING_INTEGRATION_EXAMPLES.md#higher-order-component-for-feature-gating)

### Overage Billing

Automatic charges for overages:

```javascript
{
  usage_caps: { api_calls: 10000 },
  overage_pricing: { api_calls: 0.001 }  // $1 per 1000 calls
}
```

**Learn more**: [FAQ - Overage Charges](./TIERING_FAQ.md#how-do-overage-charges-work)

## üé® Common Implementation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Freemium SaaS

```javascript
Tiers:
- Free: $0, limited features, 1000 API calls
- Pro: $49, all features, 50000 API calls
- Enterprise: $299, unlimited everything
```

**Example**: [E-commerce Setup](../examples/tier-advanced-examples.js#L13)

### Pattern 2: Usage-Based Pricing

```javascript
Tiers:
- Pay As You Go: $0 base + $0.001 per API call
- Volume Discount: Cheaper per unit at scale
```

**Example**: [Analytics Platform](../examples/tier-advanced-examples.js#L74)

### Pattern 3: Team/Seat-Based

```javascript
Tiers:
- Team: $10/seat/month, 5-25 seats
- Enterprise: Custom pricing, unlimited seats
```

**Example**: [Team Management](../examples/tier-advanced-examples.js#L188)

## üìä Success Metrics

Track these metrics to measure success:

- **Conversion Rate**: Free ‚Üí Paid upgrades
- **Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)**: Total revenue / customers
- **Overage Revenue**: Additional income from usage overages
- **Upgrade Rate**: Customers moving to higher tiers
- **Churn Rate**: Customers canceling subscriptions

**Learn more**: [Best Practices - Monitoring](./TIERING_BEST_PRACTICES.md#monitoring)

## ‚ö° Performance Benchmarks

Expected performance:
- **Enforcement checks**: < 100ms (< 20ms with caching)

- **Tier info retrieval**: < 150ms
- **Dashboard loads**: < 500ms
