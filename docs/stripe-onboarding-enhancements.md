# Stripe Onboarding Flow Enhancements

## Overview

The Staryer platform has been enhanced to provide a streamlined onboarding experience for creators by automatically importing business information from their Stripe Connect accounts. This reduces manual data entry and improves the user experience during setup.

## Features

### 1. Automatic Profile Data Import

When creators connect their Stripe account during onboarding, the system automatically extracts and imports the following information:

- **Business Name**: From Stripe's business profile, company name, or individual name
- **Business Email**: From support email or individual email
- **Business Website**: From business profile URL
- **Billing Phone**: From support phone number
- **Billing Address**: From company or individual address information

### 2. Enhanced User Experience

- **Clear Instructions**: Users are informed that their profile will be auto-populated
- **Success Indicators**: Visual confirmation when data is successfully imported
- **Review Capability**: Users can review and edit all imported information before proceeding
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful handling of cases where data cannot be imported

### 3. Security & Privacy

- Data extraction only occurs after successful Stripe OAuth authorization
- All data is handled securely through Stripe's API
- Users maintain full control over their imported data
- Error handling ensures the onboarding process continues even if data import fails

## Technical Implementation

### New Functions

#### `extractProfileDataFromStripeAccount(accessToken: string)`

Located in `src/features/creator-onboarding/controllers/stripe-connect.ts`

Extracts profile data from a Stripe Connect account using the access token obtained during OAuth flow.

**Returns:**
```typescript
{
  business_name?: string;
  business_email?: string;
  business_website?: string;
  billing_email?: string;
  billing_phone?: string;
  billing_address?: {
    line1?: string;
    line2?: string;
    city?: string;
    state?: string;
    postal_code?: string;
    country?: string;
  };
}
```

### Modified Components

#### OAuth Callback (`src/app/api/stripe-oauth-callback/route.ts`)
- Enhanced to call `extractProfileDataFromStripeAccount`
- Updates creator profile with extracted data
- Provides success/error feedback through URL parameters

#### StripeConnectStep (`src/features/creator-onboarding/components/steps/StripeConnectStep.tsx`)
- Updated UI to mention profile auto-population
- Enhanced success messages with data import status
- Added informational content about the import process

#### CreatorSetupStep (`src/features/creator-onboarding/components/steps/CreatorSetupStep.tsx`)
- Detects when data has been auto-populated
- Shows notification about imported data
- Encourages users to review all information

## Data Flow

1. **Stripe Connection**: User initiates Stripe account connection
2. **OAuth Authorization**: User authorizes on Stripe's platform
3. **Token Exchange**: System exchanges authorization code for access tokens
4. **Data Extraction**: System extracts profile data using access token
5. **Profile Update**: Creator profile is updated with Stripe data and tokens
6. **User Notification**: User is redirected with success confirmation
7. **Review & Edit**: User can review and modify imported data in setup step

## Error Handling

- **Data Extraction Failures**: Onboarding continues without imported data
- **Profile Update Errors**: User is notified but can proceed manually
- **API Errors**: Graceful fallback with appropriate user messaging
- **Missing Data**: Only available data is imported, no required fields are enforced

## Configuration

No additional configuration is required. The feature works with existing Stripe Connect setup and uses the same OAuth flow and database schema.

## Testing

The data extraction logic has been tested with mock Stripe account data to ensure proper handling of various account types and data availability scenarios.

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements could include:

- Import of product/service information from Stripe
- Logo import from Stripe business profile
- Enhanced address validation
- Bulk data synchronization options
- Custom field mapping configurations

## Compliance

This implementation follows Stripe's API usage guidelines and maintains data security best practices:

- Uses secure OAuth flow for authorization
- Processes data server-side only
- Respects user privacy and data ownership
- Provides transparent user control over imported data
