# Onboarding and Redirect Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the fixes implemented to ensure proper onboarding flows and redirects for both platform owners and creators.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Login/Signup Redirect Loop
**Problem**: Users were redirected back to login after successfully authenticating

**Root Cause**: Login and signup pages were calling `EnhancedAuthService.redirectAuthenticatedUser()` which interfered with the post-authentication redirect flow handled by auth actions.

**Solution**:
- Removed `redirectAuthenticatedUser()` calls from login and signup pages
- Auth actions (`signInWithEmailAndPassword`, `signUpWithEmailAndPassword`) already handle redirects
- This eliminates the redirect loop and allows proper post-login navigation

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` - Removed redundant redirect check
- `src/app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx` - Removed redundant redirect check

### 2. Critical Runtime Error - Supabase Client
**Problem**: Application crashed on startup with `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'cookies')`

**Root Cause**: `createSupabaseServerClient` required a NextRequest parameter but was being called from server components without it.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `src/libs/supabase/supabase-server-client.ts` to accept optional NextRequest
- Uses `cookies()` from `next/headers` when no NextRequest is provided
- Works in both server components and route handlers/middleware

### 2. Missing Auth Callback Route
**Problem**: OAuth and magic link authentication couldn't complete - no callback handler existed

**Solution**: 
- Created `src/app/(auth)/auth/callback/route.ts`
- Exchanges auth code for session
- Uses EnhancedAuthService to determine appropriate redirect based on role and onboarding status

### 3. Inconsistent Onboarding Completion
**Problem**: Platform owners used step-based completion while creators had a dedicated action

**Solution**:
- Added `completePlatformOwnerOnboardingAction()` in `src/features/platform-owner-onboarding/actions/platform-actions.ts`
- Updated `PlatformCompletionStep` to call the new action
- Now both flows have consistent, explicit completion actions

### 4. Missing Dashboard Authentication
**Problem**: Platform dashboard had no authentication or onboarding checks

**Solution**:
- Added `EnhancedAuthService.requireRole('platform_owner')` to platform dashboard
- Ensures user is authenticated, has correct role, and completed onboarding
- Automatically redirects to appropriate page if checks fail

## Authentication Flow

### Login/Signup Flow
1. User logs in via email/password or OAuth
2. `auth-actions.ts` calls `EnhancedAuthService.getUserRoleAndRedirect()`
3. Service checks user role from database (single source of truth)
4. Redirects based on role and onboarding status:
   - **Platform Owner (onboarding incomplete)**: → `/platform-owner-onboarding`
   - **Platform Owner (onboarding complete)**: → `/dashboard`
   - **Creator (onboarding incomplete)**: → `/creator/onboarding`
   - **Creator (onboarding complete)**: → `/creator/dashboard`
   - **Subscriber**: → `/`
   - **Unauthenticated**: → `/pricing`

### OAuth/Magic Link Flow
1. User clicks OAuth/magic link
2. Redirected to provider
3. Provider redirects to `/auth/callback` with code
4. Callback exchanges code for session
5. Uses `EnhancedAuthService.getUserRoleAndRedirect()` to determine redirect
6. User lands on appropriate page based on role and onboarding status

## Onboarding Completion

### Creator Onboarding
1. User completes all onboarding steps
2. `ReviewLaunchStep` calls `completeOnboardingAction()`
3. Action sets `onboarding_completed: true` in creator_profiles
4. Revalidates paths: `/creator/dashboard`, `/creator/onboarding`, storefront URLs
5. User redirected to `/creator/dashboard`

### Platform Owner Onboarding
1. User completes all 6 onboarding steps
2. `PlatformCompletionStep` calls `completePlatformOwnerOnboardingAction()`
3. Action sets `platform_owner_onboarding_completed: true` in platform_settings
4. Revalidates paths: `/dashboard`, `/platform-owner-onboarding`
5. User redirected to `/dashboard`

## Dashboard Protection

### Platform Owner Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
- Requires authentication
- Requires `platform_owner` role
- Requires completed onboarding
- Automatically redirects if any requirement not met

### Creator Dashboard (`/creator/dashboard`)
- Requires authentication
- Checks onboarding completion
- Redirects to `/creator/onboarding` if not complete
- Redirects to `/login` if not authenticated

## Files Modified

### Core Authentication
- `src/libs/supabase/supabase-server-client.ts` - Made compatible with server components
- `src/features/account/controllers/get-authenticated-user.ts` - Optional NextRequest parameter
- `src/features/account/controllers/enhanced-auth-service.ts` - Already had correct logic

### Auth Routes
- `src/app/(auth)/auth/callback/route.ts` - **NEW** - OAuth/magic link callback handler
- `src/app/(auth)/auth-actions.ts` - Already using EnhancedAuthService

### Platform Owner Onboarding
- `src/features/platform-owner-onboarding/actions/platform-actions.ts` - Added completion action
- `src/features/platform-owner-onboarding/components/steps/PlatformCompletionStep.tsx` - Calls completion action

### Creator Onboarding
- `src/features/creator-onboarding/actions/onboarding-actions.ts` - Already had completion action
- `src/features/creator-onboarding/components/steps/ReviewLaunchStep.tsx` - Already calls completion action

### Dashboard Pages
- `src/app/(platform)/dashboard/page.tsx` - Added authentication checks
- `src/app/creator/(protected)/dashboard/page.tsx` - Already had authentication checks

## Testing Checklist

### Platform Owner Flow
- [ ] Sign up as new user
- [ ] Verify redirect to platform owner onboarding
- [ ] Complete all onboarding steps
- [ ] Verify redirect to `/dashboard` after completion
- [ ] Verify can't access dashboard before onboarding complete
- [ ] Log out and log back in
- [ ] Verify redirect to `/dashboard` (onboarding already complete)

### Creator Flow
- [ ] Sign up as new user (or switch role)
- [ ] Verify redirect to creator onboarding
- [ ] Complete all onboarding steps
- [ ] Verify redirect to `/creator/dashboard` after completion
- [ ] Verify can't access dashboard before onboarding complete
- [ ] Log out and log back in
- [ ] Verify redirect to `/creator/dashboard` (onboarding already complete)

### OAuth/Magic Link
- [ ] Test GitHub OAuth login
- [ ] Test Google OAuth login
- [ ] Test magic link email login
- [ ] Verify all redirect to appropriate dashboard

## Key Principles

1. **Database as Single Source of Truth**: User roles are stored in `users.role` column
2. **Explicit Completion**: Both flows have dedicated completion actions
3. **Consistent Redirects**: EnhancedAuthService handles all redirect logic
4. **Protected Dashboards**: All dashboard pages check authentication and onboarding
5. **Flexible Supabase Client**: Works in both server components and route handlers

## Next Steps

1. Test all authentication flows thoroughly
2. Verify onboarding completion works for both roles
3. Ensure redirects work correctly in all scenarios
4. Monitor for any edge cases or issues
